### Step 1: Update the System
Before installing MariaDB, it's a good practice to update your system's package list and upgrade existing packages to their latest versions. Open a terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```
### Step 2: Install MariaDB
Once your system is up to date, you can install MariaDB using the package manager. For Ubuntu or Debian-based systems, use the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install mariadb-server
```
For CentOS or Red Hat-based systems, use:
```bash
sudo yum install mariadb-server
```
### Step 3: Secure MariaDB Installation
After installation, it's crucial to secure your MariaDB installation. Run the following command to start the security script:

```bash
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```
Follow the prompts to set a root password, remove anonymous users, disallow root login remotely, remove the test database, and reload the privilege tables.

### Step 4: Start and Enable MariaDB Service
To ensure that MariaDB starts automatically at boot, you can enable the service with the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable mariadb
```
To start the MariaDB service immediately, use:
```bash
sudo systemctl start mariadb
```
### Step 5: Access MariaDB
You can access the MariaDB server using the MySQL client. To log in as the root user, run:

```bash
sudo mysql -u root -p
```
Enter the root password you set during the secure installation process to access the MariaDB command-line interface.
### Step 6: Create a New Database and User (Optional)
If you need to create a new database and user, you can do so using the following SQL commands:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE mydatabase;
CREATE USER 'myuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'mypassword';
```
