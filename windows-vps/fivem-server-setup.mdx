Go to the FiveM Runtime website and download the server files. Here's a link to the download page: [FiveM Runtime](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_server_windows/master/)

### Step 3: Extract the downloaded files

Create a server folder inside the folder you made in step 1 and extract the downloaded files into it.

### Step 4: Start your server

Open the folder you created in step 3 and find the FxServer.exe file and double click on it to start your server.

After you start the server it will open a browser window with the txAdmin panel. Put in the code and proceed to step 5.

## Step 5: Configure Your Server Name

After accessing the txAdmin panel, you'll be prompted to set up your server configuration. Choose a short, memorable server name that will be used in the txAdmin interface and Chat/Discord messages (e.g., `tutorial`, `examplerp`, `dev`).

### Popular Recipes (Recommended)

This is the easiest option for beginners. Select a template from a curated list of community favorites. This includes QBCore, ESX, and a Default template for you to customize.

<Tip>
  Choose **Popular Recipes** if you're new to FiveM server setup or want a quick start with a pre-configured framework.
</Tip>

### Other Deployment Options:

- **Existing Server Data**: Select an existing server data folder on the host. Only use this if you already have a `server.cfg` and a `resources` folder.
  
- **Remote URL Template**: Based on a Recipe URL in the YAML format. You'll have the option to edit the Recipe before running it.
  
- **Custom Template**: Recommended if you have a custom recipe-based server or if you are writing your own recipe. You will be asked for the recipe right after this page.

<Note>
  For most users, **Popular Recipes** is the recommended choice as it provides tested and working server configurations.
</Note>

## Step 7: Review Recipe

After selecting your deployment type, you'll be presented with the recipe configuration. This shows you the YAML configuration that will be used to set up your server.

  alt="txAdmin Review Recipe"
/>

The recipe includes:
- **Engine version** (e.g., `$engine: 3`)
- **Server name** and description
- **Tasks** that will be executed (downloading resources, configuring files, etc.)
- **Source repository** information (where resources will be downloaded from)

You can review the recipe and make any changes if needed. However, for most users, the default configuration works perfectly.

<Tip>
  Simply click **Next** to proceed with the default recipe configuration. The recipe is pre-configured to work out of the box.

## Step 8: Enter Server Registration Key

Now you need to enter your FiveM Server Registration Key (formerly known as License Key). This key is required to run a FiveM server.

The key can be obtained from the [Cfx.re Portal](https://portal.cfx.re/). Enter your registration key in the field provided.

<Note>
  If you don't have a registration key yet, visit the Cfx.re Portal to create one. For more information, check the guide: [How to create a registration key](https://docs.fivem.net/docs/server-manual/setting-up-a-server/#license-key-registration).
</Note>

Once you've entered your key, click **Run Recipe** to proceed with the server setup.

## Step 9: Configure server.cfg

After the recipe runs, you'll be presented with the `server.cfg` file editor. This is your server's main configuration file where you can customize various settings.

Click **Save & Run Server** to start your FiveM server.
