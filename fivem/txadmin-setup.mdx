## Step 1: Start Your FiveM Server

When you start your FiveM server for the first time, txAdmin will automatically initialize. Look for the console output that displays important information.

  alt="txAdmin Console Output"
/>

In the console, you'll see a message that says **"All ready! Please access:"** 

You'll also see a **PIN code** displayed below with the text **"Use the PIN below to register:"**

<Note>
  Make sure to note down the PIN code - you'll need it in the next step to set up your master account.
</Note>

## Step 2: Access the txAdmin Panel

Copy the url that includes the ip address displayed in your console and paste it into your web browser.

## Step 3: Configure Your Server Name

After accessing the txAdmin panel, you'll be prompted to set up your server configuration. Choose a short, memorable server name that will be used in the txAdmin interface and Chat/Discord messages (e.g., `tutorial`, `examplerp`, `dev`).

## Step 4: Choose Your Deployment Type

Next, you'll need to select how you want to set up your server. txAdmin offers several deployment options:

### Popular Recipes (Recommended)

This is the easiest option for beginners. Select a template from a curated list of community favorites. This includes QBCore, ESX, and a Default template for you to customize.

<Tip>
  Choose **Popular Recipes** if you're new to FiveM server setup or want a quick start with a pre-configured framework.
</Tip>

### Other Deployment Options:

- **Existing Server Data**: Select an existing server data folder on the host. Only use this if you already have a `server.cfg` and a `resources` folder.
  
- **Remote URL Template**: Based on a Recipe URL in the YAML format. You'll have the option to edit the Recipe before running it.
  
- **Custom Template**: Recommended if you have a custom recipe-based server or if you are writing your own recipe. You will be asked for the recipe right after this page.

<Note>
  For most users, **Popular Recipes** is the recommended choice as it provides tested and working server configurations.
</Note>

## Step 5: Review Recipe

After selecting your deployment type, you'll be presented with the recipe configuration. This shows you the YAML configuration that will be used to set up your server.

<img

  alt="txAdmin Review Recipe"
/>

The recipe includes:
- **Engine version** (e.g., `$engine: 3`)
- **Server name** and description
- **Tasks** that will be executed (downloading resources, configuring files, etc.)
- **Source repository** information (where resources will be downloaded from)

You can review the recipe and make any changes if needed. However, for most users, the default configuration works perfectly.

<Tip>
  Simply click **Next** to proceed with the default recipe configuration. The recipe is pre-configured to work out of the box.

## Step 6: Enter Server Registration Key

Now you need to enter your FiveM Server Registration Key (formerly known as License Key). This key is required to run a FiveM server.

  alt="Server Registration Key Input"
/>

The key can be obtained from the [Cfx.re Portal](https://portal.cfx.re/). Enter your registration key in the field provided.

  alt="Server Registration Key Field"
/>

<Note>
  If you don't have a registration key yet, visit the Cfx.re Portal to create one. For more information, check the guide: [How to create a registration key](https://docs.fivem.net/docs/server-manual/setting-up-a-server/#license-key-registration).
</Note>

Once you've entered your key, click **Run Recipe** to proceed with the server setup.

## Step 7: Configure server.cfg

After the recipe runs, you'll be presented with the `server.cfg` file editor. This is your server's main configuration file where you can customize various settings.

<Tip>
  If you're using a game panel, make sure to check your assigned port on the game panel and update the `endpoint_add_tcp` and `endpoint_add_udp` settings in the server.cfg to match your correct game port.
</Tip>

Click **Save & Run Server** to start your FiveM server.
